           @par Short description
           PRM is a planner that constructs a roadmap of milestones
           that approximate the connectivity of the state space. The
           milestones are valid states in the state space. Near-by
           milestones are connected by valid motions. Finding a motion
           plan that connects two given states is reduced to a
           discrete search (this implementation uses Dijskstra) in the
           roadmap.
           The construction process for the roadmap includes an
           expansion strategy. This expansion strategy is not included
           in this implementation, hence the name BasicPRM.
